Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
When we worked on the draw2d program I saw how making efficient functions can accelerate the code writing process and save a lot of time.
Writing a function that can be reused in different places is very beneficial for the future of the code.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

It can help save time and evaluate if a function is working as intended.
It is good to check a function throughout the programs making so that you know exactly when something breaks.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

I would run the debugger, find the exact problem, and look into the error and error code to see if I can find any additional information.
Then I would go into the program and make the needed adjustments and potentially write a test function to see if it works.
